1. maybe shrink the size of graph when edges/vertices are removed
2. integrate the weight into graph?
3. implement weighted graph, such that adjacency list is of the form:
   ((x . w1) (y . w2) (z . w3) ...)
4. shortest path for weighted graph
5. watch out for negative weights
6. return SCC and CC in lists or in separate graphs?
